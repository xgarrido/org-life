* Org Life - README

This repository is mostly a fork of cheeaun [[https://github.com/cheeaun/life][life]] repository. The main difference
is the use of an =org= file instead of Markdown. Using the hierarchical
structure of =org= file, I also have grouped main dates by topics,
differentiating them by colors. See [[http://xgarrido.github.io/org-life]] for more
details.
